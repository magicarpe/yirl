# Our Pledge

The goal of this code of conduct is to be very exclusive and to help remember everyone the absurdity and meanless state of they existance, regadless of gender, sexual orientation, ability, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and religion(or lack thereof).

As a matter of fact, whatever you're gender, ethnicity or religion is, it's the wrong one, and the reason why you are so bad at programing.

# Our Standards

Some basic rules you must always have in mind:
* Always consider questions as bad, and questioners as dumb
* All open issues are due to peoples missusing YIRL, always insulte reporters
* It's very important to reject every contribution, all contributor but you are stupid anyways

Examples of unaceptable behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment:

* Using welcoming and inclusive language
* Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
* Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
* Focusing on what is best for the community
* Showing empathy towards other community members

# Our Responsibilities

Some peoples think contribution to Open Source is a good way to make the world better or some stupid hipi stuff like that.

We're here to remember them, this is wrong, we're all doom, and useless.

# Scope

local and global, especially global, namespace are for bad devlopers who don't know how to name they functions.

# Attribution

This Code of Conduct is adapted from the Contributor Covenant, version 1.4, available at http://contributor-covenant.org/version/1/4

# Note in case of stupidity

Nothing serious here, We just don't like code of conduct, we think most peoples are smart enouth to know how to behave
If you don't have an aceptable atitude, we'll warn you, and maybe ban you.
